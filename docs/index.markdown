## Contributing
This package is new and its functionality is not complete. So I'll be glad for any contribution. You may either resolve existing issues or suggest your own ideas - any kind of help will be useful for making this package better.

I will be especially glad if you are good in CSS styling or/and writing UI tests, because I'm not very good at it myself.

You may find current issues [here](https://github.com/qpep3b/react-recrud/issues).
